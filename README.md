# Grand Prix Playoffs

> Reimagining the Formula 1 Drivers' Championship as a true elimination battle.

**Live at [grandprixplayoffs.com](https://grandprixplayoffs.com)**

Grand Prix Playoffs is an independent, fan-made web application that restructures the F1 World Drivers' Championship into a playoff format. Using official Grand Prix results, the season culminates in a winner-take-all final race among four drivers.

## How It Works

The last 7 races of the F1 season become a playoff:

| Phase          | Races           | Drivers | Outcome             |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| Regular Season | 1 through (N-7) | All     | Top 10 qualify      |
| Round 1        | 2 races         | 10 → 8  | Bottom 2 eliminated |
| Round 2        | 2 races         | 8 → 6   | Bottom 2 eliminated |
| Round 3        | 2 races         | 6 → 4   | Bottom 2 eliminated |
| Final          | 1 race          | 4       | Winner takes title  |

Points reset at the start of each playoff round. Standard F1 points apply (race, sprint, pole, fastest lap).
